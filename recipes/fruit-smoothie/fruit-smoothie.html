    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fruit smoothies are a great way to start the day! This recipe contains blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries
        for antioxidants, spinach, chard, and kale for iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamins A, C, and K
        (don't worry, you can't taste them in the smoothie), and orange juice for vitamin C and taste. It's simple, easy
        to make, and provides a kickstart for your energy that's much healthier than coffee.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One cup of mixed leafy greens (I use spinach, chard, and kale, the so-called "power greens.")</li>
        <li>One cup of mixed berries (I use blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.)</li>
        <li>Enough orange juice to cover the rest of the ingredients</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the leafy greens and berries.</li>
        <li>Place the leafy greens and berries in a blender.</li>
        <li>Pour orange juice over the leafy greens and berries until they are below the surface.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth.</li>
    </ol>
